# Codility-Practice1
# Challenge 1: No ifs no buts(Toy Problem)
#### Write a function that accepts two numbers a and b and returns whether a is smaller than, bigger than, or equal to b, as a string.

Example: 

(5, 4)   ---> "5 is greater than 4"

(-4, -7) ---> "-4 is greater than -7"

(2, 2)   ---> "2 is equal to 2"
There is only one problem...

You cannot use if statements, and you cannot use the ternary operator ? 

In fact, the word if and the character ? are not allowed in your code.

 

# Challenge2: Ordered Count of Characters(Toy Problem)
#### Count the number of occurrences of each character and return it as a (list of arrays) in order of appearance. For empty output return (an empty list).

Example:

"abracadabra" ---->  [['a', 5], ['b', 2], ['r', 2], ['c', 1], ['d', 1]]

"Code Wars -----> [['C', 1], ['o', 1], ['d', 1], ['e', 1], [' ', 1], ['W', 1], ['a', 1], ['r', 1], ['s', 1]]

"233312", ------> [['2', 2], ['3', 3], ['1', 1 ]]
